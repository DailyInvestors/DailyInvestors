Note: Quick Fix: For my fiture clients, currently I know and understand everything on Technology, every language basically at a Advanced level. Now I am fresh to developing, etc. I went and studied straight for four years + a lifetime of hacking around. Thus being said, any task, project I can figure it out. I wont take a job, if I dont believe I can handle it. Uponmy geowing my Business, if it is a Major Contract/Project. I will work or build it first. I know ly capabilities and weaknesses. Where I am at on my testing. Focusing on my weaknesses. I believe qhen you fear, or have a weakness. You dont run, confront it. Or study it. My goal in 10-20 Years, be that guy of anyone has issues, I can take xare if it. To be my best for them, or anyone around me, I have to be at my Best. Getting Sober and Clean, and away from all the wrong people, negativity, Got me back to Myself. Now after earning 100's of certificates Basic to Advanced all Security and Developing, I am setting out for my Trophy, testing everything I learned. But coming out as I have, tryong to help people make Money, Secure themselves and Teach made me tons of enemies for what? Cus their jealous they dont have my mind. But we all yave our weaknesses and Strengths. No reason to be jealous, ask a Question and Ill help if its on some good stuff or security. Testong is one thing, everything else another. And to better my life, and those around me the other had no part in my story ðŸ’¯. Back to notes lol
My Education 100s of Books. College Education for Cyber Security, thousands of Hours on LinkedIn Learning on all their College Courses. I read the full Book in college when we were required to read a Chapter. Saved them All. Read thousands of Blogs, Google Docs, Microsoft Docs, GitHub Docs. Ive done some labs, did a Few HacktheBox, but Im not letting anyone in my system. My criminal background, mixed with Religious Upbrining, and my life ling wars and stories all combined with everything above, Will Make Me One of the Best Risk Management Businesses One Day. I Cant be controled, bought out, I just do my own thing, win or loose. And I bring all this to every and any client future or past. A Journey of a Thousand Miles Begins with a Single Step "Lao Tzu". All this equals, probably one if the Most Talented in America that is Freelancing. LinkedIN Learning will Verify Everything, unless you want a Demo ðŸ˜† then I would do some of things, I normally wouldnt ðŸ’¯

FYI: I learned More from Books, Open-Source and Blogs then anything in College. My college education taught me everything else, that will make me successful, such as Laws, Policies, And Real Security that as I state everything normally is always unlocked. If your my client, Paranoid mode woth 1000+ robots guarding every little inch. You want a AI it wil be Self-Learning. You want a App, Im the only one touching it. You need help, AnyTime ðŸ’¯

Under Attack on all Lines üòÜ 
Well be offline for a few days, qil come back with a sick little security robot.


Note: Both Profiles Daily Investors && Dailys Daily News, are both kind of unorganized. However, I am under attack. That situation is about to be over.
As I am growing into my career, tons of people will test me. Test me probably on a Daily Basis. However if I do work for anyone remote or physcial location. I will change networks, systems, etc to ensure your safety and Privacy. In this day and age with Cyber Attacks growing on a Daily Basis, if you help support it will be to continue my research and eventually hace the sickest Security App out their for Personal Use Only!




Note: Coincidence. First I graduated college several months back, trying my hardest to change my life. Well went to take my CSCu test, I have proof. Everytime I did it said my vouchure wasnt good. Next i contact all parties involved. The school says its good, so did the ECC Board. Next I was already approved by the Gov for my Doctors. To be the first person in my family to be considered a Dr. Well I said fk the CSCu wasnt even what i wanted to go to school for. Counselors their didnt help at all. Next my vouchure was revoked. Still have several months to take it.Then all of a sudden my funding got canceled, the school got on BS. Blamed it on Elon MUsk and Trump. asl my chat groups, got evidence on over 100 platforms. Now my Github education. Keot havinfg error after error while I was in college. I can pinoint the teacher/course, etc. Made complaints with several states, BBB, etc. Now all of it just happened again today. My entire life I always get judged by how I look, or what I did when I was 12 years old. I did 12 years in prsion, arrested on my 21st birthday, because my best friend beat on his girl and told on me. Never did I steal,. nothing. I have been framed several times in my life. My grandparents def were Preachers, I def dont and never have been bad business. My entire life ill help the little people, and if anything bully the bully. But never even on that. My entire life, my family, etc never once believed in me. My mom did, but died when I was 12. Doctors fault, they didnt do gtheir job and run labs. As i grow into myself, who GOD made me. The devil is throwing BS at every corner. For one even as a Cyber Security Specialist, I will never wont gov clearance. Not my problem. I just try to always do the right thing, but every where I go, people mistake my kindness for a weakness. I have cops beat me down, arrest me for things I have never did. Been setup, and did my time. Got a lawyer who made tons bogus Promises, and another lawyer who will verify it. Got another attorney that doesnt know how to respond. Wrote emails to the ACLu, and letters. Never a response. My dad died over a year ago, and I havent changed who I am! Everyone wants to judge people by paper, by history. History doesnt have to repeat itself. ANd now got HAters on every side coming at me, Billion Dollar corporations hacking into my cameras in my bedroom? For what? Cus i learned something , am I doing any BS at all? Technically havmt been ion trouble for years, graduated college, and I will keep going and learning and helping anyone I can. But once again the "Daily" life of Daily.



FYI: I am in a Major Lawsuit, and my attroney got blocked. Real Case, I dont have to lie to kick it. People died in that rehab, I went four days with nurses saying I took my medication, but low key they were stealing it and selling it. Getting high inside the building, but im a smart honest guy, each time. Wrote a piece of paper and walked straight to the camera, and told the owners save it for court. But some of my attacks could be retailation from that? Who really knows, and aint even worth my time to worry about it. Got better things to do, and rebuild my life with my Higher Power, take care of my family. Even one day if i do contract from our gov, I would never do the things that are happening to me, to my worst enemey.

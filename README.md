    Why Choose Team Daily?????? First, I choose Risk Management, reason why? I used to do all them bogus tricks, lived in the worst cities in America,
    I have seen it all and some. Despite my juvinile background, and criminal history I am truly rightious on everything, Karma a Big Beliver.
    But after changing my life around, getting Sober, Graduating College First in my family. Choose Technology, and its the one thing no body belives lol

    I have been focusing on Red Team for two years now, so on the field, FULL TIME. They attack you, i already got their info, if their not good lol. Next I custom config anything,
    99% of the people in your system lol, probably cant do anything. But as I go through suit after suit standing on business after businessto help protect
    the inoncent that dont believe, this same work ethic goes for my clients. As my name is growing througout the Stock and Technology world,
    id like to say just as DuckDuckGo really came out now, in about 10-20 Ill be doing the same.  THat is if it dont take off, any day now 100

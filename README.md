My opinion, all Security needs to have customized Robots to help monitor and secure. All systems including Mobile Devices need iptables configured with forwards and Proximities.

Depending on Job: 
Will Develop a Preview Model before any contract is signed. This way you can get a Free Demo. 
If you wish for AIs, if it is one custom it will Cost. If it is a set contract for so many different models in different frameworks, minimum amount 1 million, however per the set time span, end date. We can come up with a Number for the set amount you want developed. To enhance the speed features, I will create Agents to create and randomize the functions and functionality of these. So instead of 100 workers, I make AIs to make my AIs all under my Supervision and üëÅÔ∏è.

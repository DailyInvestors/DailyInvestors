Note: Some of you may know a little about all the issues that I am facing. One I do not lie, i will avoid a question but not lie. As I am starting a 
Risk Management, and focusing on Cyber Security and Pen Testing, one of the events will be ending soon. Either way, im about to figure it all out,
caught and verified several connections to where their story or alibi does not match. As these local know nothing about me, and I do have valuable resources around me, that I have kept a secret. This part of the show, will be soon purged. My research side of Team Daily, about to expose everything.
Every seen the stories, on all these different shows to where the victim will confront the attackers right at their door in the act. About to do the same. And to all of my 12,000 trackers this Morning. To the few of you that keep dismounting me, trying to ruin my work, and progress. I have each of you caught in so many different ways. You dont have to have termux, nethunter, to run sock5 proxies, run tunnels to see everything. Got several companies that are helping me. So @ lol, Im not afraid of war especially a Cyber War. But with the way my life is, who has more to loose?????


Next NOTE: I purposley didnt place all my Python Notes. While im getting hammered, dismounted on my UNLOCKED SYSTEMS. Today, only PYTHON!
Whats crazy, got so many people in my personal life, lieing, everyone taking the same stories. But actions speak louder then words. Persistence is what
got me this far on one of my "Personal Research Projects". However, the have no clue what Technology is, what I know, anything. These people stole a few of my school notes, probably learned a few tools. But why these people joke around, lie,../../../etc/ I am just getting that much better. While they are wasting time, and I take it they are purposley trying to hurt me. Several outside sources will agree and confirm. But that nice guy is still here, and what they will have instore. My future movie and book about MY LIFE. Crasiest stories ive ever seen, heard. Who else has been in the worst prisons in America, had Grandfathers that started Churches all over the Globe. Why everyone trys to stop and ruin my work, Thank You for being my motivation to continue tpo Better Myself, and Helpo those around me. Cus once I make it, I will never look back. 
The Sky is The Limit, and the cloud is what? 20 layers closer haha

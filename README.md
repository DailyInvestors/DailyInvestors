Note: Some of you may know a little about all the issues that I am facing. One I do not lie, i will avoid a question but not lie. As I am starting a 
Risk Management, and focusing on Cyber Security and Pen Testing, one of the events will be ending soon. Either way, im about to figure it all out,
caught and verified several connections to where their story or alibi does not match. As these local know nothing about me, and I do have valuable resources around me, that I have kept a secret. This part of the show, will be soon purged. My research side of Team Daily, about to expose everything.
Every seen the stories, on all these different shows to where the victim will confront the attackers right at their door in the act. About to do the same. And to all of my 12,000 trackers this Morning. To the few of you that keep dismounting me, trying to ruin my work, and progress. I have each of you caught in so many different ways. You dont have to have termux, nethunter, to run sock5 proxies, run tunnels to see everything. Got several companies that are helping me. So @ lol, Im not afraid of war especially a Cyber War. But with the way my life is, who has more to loose?????


Next NOTE: I purposley didnt place all my Python Notes. While im getting hammered, dismounted on my UNLOCKED SYSTEMS. Today, only PYTHON!
Whats crazy, got so many people in my personal life, lieing, everyone taking the same stories. But actions speak louder then words. Persistence is what
got me this far on one of my "Personal Research Projects". However, the have no clue what Technology is, what I know, anything. These people stole a few of my school notes, probably learned a few tools. But why these people joke around, lie,../../../etc/ I am just getting that much better. While they are wasting time, and I take it they are purposley trying to hurt me. Several outside sources will agree and confirm. But that nice guy is still here, and what they will have instore. My future movie and book about MY LIFE. Crasiest stories ive ever seen, heard. Who else has been in the worst prisons in America, had Grandfathers that started Churches all over the Globe. Why everyone trys to stop and ruin my work, Thank You for being my motivation to continue tpo Better Myself, and Helpo those around me. Cus once I make it, I will never look back. 
The Sky is The Limit, and the cloud is what? 20 layers closer haha



Note: So i have had 5 awards, told this Major Business everything where to send, not to. All the problems that are going on. They keep sending my Payments to Bug Crowd. Didnt even have a Bug Crowd account. I am registered with the IRS and Own Cyborg Tek, been on Google for Years. Now the client I was testing, all in my bedroom cameras, in every system catching them with IDD, and have several key writtness on these sabotaging attacks. As I suffer from PTSD, this is affecting my overall health. Stress, Anxiety, No Sleep, Nightmares measing up my relationships at home and causing my business to loose clients. I thought these Bug Programs were that find something, get attacked. Recreate each attack, and show the real one. I have done all that and More. Now my First RCE money ??? Keeps going to Bug Crowd. Had a payment with Legacy set up Years ago. I never once said that.Then to log in, Bug Crowd or someone is On BS, denying all two factor Authentication. Now i could do a brute force, but im already in Federal Court on a Major suit, I started. Did the 1987 act myself. In prison I helped innocent victims win over 1 million off my Policy Research. Now I got the Biggest Technology Companies in my Bed Room Cameras, sabotaging everything I do. Even the good stuff. Now as a Hacker, def aint a snitch. But on the business aspect, I dont play with Nopnes money, Never been bad business even when I was 13 years old selling Crack. Now all these companies are resorting to sick and malicious ways to sabotage my wvery move. This is coming from companies that actually have National Security Clearance. But having National Security Clearance, does that give you the write to steal from a past partner? A future Partner? I didnt know all ghe millions you guys made, that it was to support your cause of truong to slander and ruin the small Businesses. If anyone else has gone through this situation, please contact me and I wil give you my attorneys info. 

To all the parties involved, im not what ever you think. Yal better ask the people that know me. State Senators, Mayors, and all.

Note. A 1987 Act is printable, takes 2 minutes or less to sign, seal, send. A router maybe a day, longer depending if you got the IP, SSID, how you are doing it. A million different ways, but remember I did just Graduate College 2 months ago. JS

Explanation: So some of this above makes since. Basically in several Cyber Wars. Which I mean, its like wtf. My systems are unlocked. Nothing to brag about. But when money os on the line. Thats on one thing I dont play about. Then on top of it, not my security, not my client. Trying to make Honest money. And as I test, ill make a patch eventually for the same attack that just happened to me. For a year now, been getting hammered. And some how a Huge Target, like wtf is Daily ðŸ˜† 
Im that Mfr, that will come clean house. Im that mfr that aint scared to back down, deapite taking all my systems. Dr.web was Built for a Reason lol. But unlike all the malicious actors, im just trying to make Partnerships with everybody. Make money, but for us all. Their is definitely enough for everybody. But being a small business, and a sole proprietor every body thinks they can do me some type of way, and not have any consequence. And this is going not just for myself, but Billions All Across The Globe.

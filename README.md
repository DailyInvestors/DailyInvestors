"Just because im a good guy, Dont Mistake my Kindness for Weakness" ~~Al Capone~~~


To Anyone and Everyone.
      I got a couple days of reading to go. Was raised if you do something, do it right the First Time or try your Best. I contacted a few Businesses, if you want anything Built. You have to go through GitHub @First to establish communication. However, toss them your üí°, and I will make you a preview model -security basically, it will be Public on GitHub. However, I am going to be Busy the Next few Days. I got a couple Books I want to finish and Power Read. I will after that be on My Testing, Patching, Patches, and start getting in on any if the Flows. pretty sure my attackers are going to leave me alone. I am not on BS with anybody. No different then any of yal, trying to figure how to get better and make $. All my problems, I hate to say it. $ is the only way to get out , take care of my loved ones, and focus on a Better Life üß¨. In the future, Ill put ky life into Books, and yal will be like üò±üò≥, but woth my past, that is my motivation to Never Give Up, Keep Studying , Patching, and available for Any Technology Job as long as I think, feel, know I can handle it.
